# SCOPE - Sales Conversion Optimization and Prediction Engine

SCOPE is a predictive tool that helps businesses maximize their sales potential by analyzing how products are viewed, added to the cart, and purchased. It uses a linear regression model to estimate how many more units of a product could have been sold based on customer actions.

## Features
- **Predict missed sales opportunities**: Identify products that could have sold more based on views and cart additions.
- **Optimize conversion rates**: Track which products are being viewed or added to the cart but not purchased, and improve their performance.
- **Data-driven decisions**: Get actionable insights to prioritize marketing and sales strategies.

## How It Works
1. **Input Data**: Provide product data including items viewed, items added to cart, and items purchased.
2. **Prediction**: The model predicts potential sales based on product views and cart additions.
3. **Results**: Export a report of the top 250 items with the highest potential sales growth.
